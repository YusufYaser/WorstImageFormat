# Worst Image Format

This is the worst image format you'll ever find! (probably)

# Disclaimer

For very obvious reasons, use it only for fun, do not use it in a serious project.

There are multiple issues with this image format which I'm working on fixing them.

# How to use

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Convert an image

1. You need to download the repository files
2. Get any kind of image, and convert it using `./main.py convert <source> <output>`. (You may need to allow execution using `chmod +x ./main.py`)
3. After conversion is done, run `./main.py <output>`

# Usage

```bash
# convert normal image format to worst image format
./main.py convert <source> <output>

# generate a random image
./main.py random <width> <height> <output>

# view an image
./main.py <image>
```
